Ton is a boy approaching adolescence and feels a deep emotional discomfort. An encounter with a woman full of wisdom will give him clues on how to deal with his insecurities.

Together with her, he will explore the mystery of tears to learn the value of being yourself, trying to know yourself and not comparing yourself to others. She will discover that each one of us has within us a sea of emotions and that tears, like droplets of that sea, appear in our hearts.
droplets of that sea, appear to tell us about them. But not all tears are the same or serve the same purpose.
