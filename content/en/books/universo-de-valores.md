Sol and Luna are two little brothers who travel through a Galaxy where the planets and satellites have become Values. On each planet or satellite, they meet "Marcianita", a being who will share with them something about how life is lived in that place. 
This is an exciting journey for children and their caregivers, a story full of meaning and significance that on any of its routes leads to love.
