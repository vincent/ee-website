Graduated in Industrial Design at TEC de Monterrey CDMX, she did her postgraduate studies at Central Saint Martins - University of the Arts London (Visual Presentation) and at the European Institute of Design in Barcelona (Ephemeral Architecture).

Later, her interest in children's literature and the artistic processes to create an illustrated album, motivated her to take a course in "Character Design" taught by the Illustrator Valeria Gallo at IBBY Mexico and an intensive Illustration Workshop entitled "Emotions, Characters and Spaces" led by the Illustrator Rebeca Luciani in Barcelona.
<br>

Currently she has published several children's books with various publishers in Mexico and Spain.
<br>

The books she has illustrated are linked to topics such as emotional intelligence, conscious upbringing, mental health and scientific dissemination.

Inequality and children's rights are the focus of her next projects.
