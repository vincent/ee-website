Elsa studied Industrial Design in Mexico City and continued her studies specialising in Visual Merchandising and Ephemeral Architecture in London and Barcelona. 
<br><br>
As a result of her interest in other creative processes and the reencounter with her passion for drawing and art, she began to explore the world of Illustration within Children's Literature.
<br><br>
Since her foray into illustration, she has collaborated in the creation of children's books published by various publishers in Mexico and Spain, picture books that address issues such as emotional intelligence, mental health, conscious parenting and scientific dissemination.
<br><br>
Recently, the projects she is planning involve some of the issues she is most interested in, such as inequality and children's rights.
<br><br>
She currently lives in Barcelona and works for Mexico and Spain.
