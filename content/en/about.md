She studied Industrial Design in Mexico and continued her studies in London and Barcelona. She is currently an illustrator and collaborates in projects dedicated to promoting children through art.
<br>

Her work has been published in several publishing houses and the books she has participated in are focused on emotional management, mental health and conscious parenting.
<br>

One of her favourite activities: reading an illustrated story before going to sleep, and if this moment is shared, all the better!
<br>

A purpose: to help more girls and boys discover the magic of picture books; in them I found stimulating, fun and at the same time healing universes.
