Since her foray into illustration, she has collaborated in the creation of children's books published by various publishers in Mexico and Spain, picture books that address issues such as emotional intelligence, mental health, conscious parenting and scientific dissemination.

Recently, the projects she is planning involve some of the issues she is most interested in, such as inequality and children's rights.
